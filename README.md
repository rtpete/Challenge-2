# Ant on a Grid Simulation

This code is a solution to the given Challenge #2:
> An ant is sitting on a grid of white and black squares.  Initially the grid is all white and the ant faces right.  
At each step it does the following:  
At a white square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees right (clockwise), and move forward one unit.  
At a black square, flip the color of the square, turn 90 degrees left (counterclockwise), and move forward one unit.  
Write a program in Python to simulate the first K moves that the ant makes and display the grid at each move on an interface.  The only input to the method is the number of moves K.  

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.

2. Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed.

3. Run the script with Python and provide the number of steps as a command line argument.

For example:
~~~
python ant_on_a_grid.py 50
